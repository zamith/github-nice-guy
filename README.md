# Github Nice Guy

Let's face it, open pull requests are often forgotten. It can happen for a
multitude of reasons, ranging from losing interest in the project, to a comment
that was never answered.

Github Nice Guy is a small Ruby script that fetches the open pull requests for a
given user (or organization) and sends a weekly friendly reminder with links to
them to whoever you think should know about it.

This is how it looks:

## Getting Started

The best way to get Github Nice Guy up and running is to clone this repo into a
server.

```
cd /any/path/you/like
git clone git@github.com:zamith/github-nice-guy.git
```

## Configuration

All the configuration is done through environment variables. Albeit possible to
use `export` to set all the variables, [dotenv](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv)
has been added for convenience.

If you've never used dotenv, what it does is read from a `.env` file and load
all the variables in there into environment variables. A Github Nice Guy
configuration file looks like this:

```
GITHUB_BASIC_AUTH=username:password
SEARCH_USER=user_or_orgnization_name
RECIPIENTS=one@example.com,two@example.com
SMTP_ADDRESS=smtp_address # e.g. smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_DOMAIN=smtp_domain # e.g. gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=smtp_port # e.g. 587
SMTP_USERNAME=smtp_username
SMTP_PASSWORD=smtp_password
SMTP_AUTH=smtp_auth # e.g. plain
```

`GITHUB_BASIC_AUTH` is optional, it is only needed if you want to search through
private repos as well.

`SMTP_ADDRESS`, `SMTP_DOMAIN`, `SMTP_PORT` and `SMTP_AUTH` will take the
defaults in the comments if none are passed.

## Running it

Once the configuration is done, you should be able to run it:

```
export RUN=true; bundle exec ruby github_nice_guy.rb
```

By default the script does not do anything when ran, thus the setting of the
`RUN` variable. To make it go back to it's former behaviour, unset the variable.

```
unset RUN
```

*Note:* The API call and emails are being sent from the same process of the
program, so it may take a minute or two, depending on your connection.

### Cron jobs

The best way to have a server execute a repeating job is to schedule it as a
cron job.

To help with that, Github Nice Guy uses
[whenever](https://github.com/javan/whenever). You can change the file at
`config/schedule.rb` as you prefer (or leave it as is), and when you're done
run:

```
bundle exec whenever -w github_nice_guy
```

That should do it. If you didn't change the schedule you'll be getting an email
every day at 9 am local time to the server.
